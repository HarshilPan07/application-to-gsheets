# Job Application Tracker Chrome Extension

A new way to keep track of your job applications on Google Sheets and streamline the entire process.

Coming to the Google Chrome Store soon!

# Description

Applying for jobs can be a long and tiresome journey, so keeping track of your progress in an efficient manner becomes an essential part of the process. There are usually two options when it comes down to tracking your applications: 

1. Using only a spreadsheet and manually adding the details after every application, which can be very time-consuming and repetitive
2. "Outsourcing" this work to another service/application, which may require a lot of work to learn properly, set up, and maintain

However, I believe a ***middle-ground*** between these two options is the best choice for most people: we can take the **familiarity + accessbility** of Google Sheets and the **efficiency + data-driven insights** of job application tracking websites to create a lightweight, easy to use, and efficient extension.

# Usage

### Adding Job Details

The extension will automatically create a new Google Sheet when you add your first job. This sheet can be found at *sheets.google.com* after you log into your account.
